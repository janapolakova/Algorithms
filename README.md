#### FIZZBUZZ

Program accepts a file as its first argument. The file contains multiple separated lines; each line contains 3 numbers that are space delimited. The first number is the first divider (X), the second number is the second divider (Y), and the third number is how far you should count (N). 

Output will be list of numbers 1 through N. Numbers divisible by X will be replaced with “F”, numbers divisible by Y with “B” and numbers divisible by both with “FB”.
